- How to dynamically generate UI elements with vanilla JavaScript using `createElement` and `appendChild`.
- How to fetch and render data from an external `JSON` file.
- How to manage UI state (active/inactive extensions) and apply conditional class toggling to filter items.
- How to implement a dark/light theme toggle and persist the user's preference using `localStorage`.
- How to provide visual feedback through animated toast messages for better user experience.
